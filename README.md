# Farebox Data Cleaning

An AutoHotKey implementation for automatically resolving GFI farebox validation errors caused by the GMV Syncromatics CAD/AVL system. This will only work with Santa Cruz Metro's systems, and needs information from internal documents to work properly, which I can't publish here.
