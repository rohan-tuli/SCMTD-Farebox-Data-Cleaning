# Farebox Data Cleaning

An AutoHotKey implementation for automatically resolving GFI farebox validation errors caused by the GMV Syncromatics CAD/AVL system. This should work for transit systems other than Santa Cruz Metro, but I haven't tested it (and to be honest, it didn't work a lot of the time for Metro).
